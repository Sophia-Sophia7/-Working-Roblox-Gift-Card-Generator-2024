Roblox: Easy Ways To Get Robux Free
You can earn free Robux using Microsoft Rewards, and it is the best. You just have to do some odd jobs on Bing and perform some specific searches to earn reward points. Then, you can redeem these Microsoft Reward points to get free Roblox with ease. However, the Robux gift card comes and goes in the Microsoft Reward section. Currently, you can earn 800-1000 Robux from Microsoft Rewards.

1. Design Custom Clothing
If you have a creative side then you should consider starting your own Roblox avatar clothing brand. You can create pants, shirts, and t-shirts for avatars which players can purchase in the store.

2. A Membership
If you sign up for a premium membership then you are automatically given a stipend of so many Robux each month. If you pay $4.99 per month then you will receive 450 Robux, while those paying $9.99 a month will be given 1,000 Robux per month.

The highest tier will charge you $19.99 a month and you will be given 2,200 Robux which is more than enough to have fun with and buy expensive limited items.

3. Microsoft Rewards
Microsoft Rewards are essentially tasks that reward you with Robux. As you complete tasks, you will be rewarded with points that can be redeemed for a reward. To get 100 Robux, you will need 1,500 points. This may sound like a lot, but some tasks reward a hefty amount of points. For example, you can answer questions on ‘This or That?’ and earn up to 50 points.

4. PLS DONATE

PLS DONATE is a unique game that allows you to donate Robux to other players. More often than not, you will be dealing with small amounts of Robux, as shown in the image above.

By logging in daily and donating, you can earn Giftbux, which can be used to purchase items such as a donation booth. It’s important to note that prior to setting up your booth, you will need to create a Gamepass to sell. Here, you can check out a quick tutorial on how to do so.

5. Purchase Robux
Finally, you can purchase Robux if the membership doesn’t give you enough. The price intervals for purchasing Robux in bulk are the same as membership prices. You will pay $4.99 for 400 Robux, $9.99 for 800 Robux, or $19.99 for 1,700 Robux.

Subscribing to the monthly membership is a slightly better deal if you only plan to purchase Robux once a month. We recommend purchasing the Roblox membership first before you begin to purchase Robux in bulk. If the amount you get for the membership is not enough, you can always buy more.
